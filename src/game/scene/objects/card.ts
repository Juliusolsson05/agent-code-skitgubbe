// A playing card (spec §8.2). Cards are the hero asset and get the most geometry budget.
//
// ── WHY "ROUNDED STOCK + TWO DECAL PLANES" AND NOT THE OBVIOUS ALTERNATIVES ──
//
//   BoxGeometry            → square corners. Real cards are rounded, and at this camera
//                            angle the corners are visible enough to look wrong.
//   one ExtrudeGeometry    → rounded, but its two cap faces share ONE material group, so
//                            the front and back cannot carry different textures. Fatal:
//                            a card needs a face AND a back. Its cap UVs are also raw
//                            shape coordinates, not 0→1, so the art would need remapping.
//
// So: an extruded rounded body in card-stock white, plus two thin PlaneGeometry decals
// (clean 0→1 UVs by construction) floated 0.8mm above each face. The white stock shows
// as a hairline margin around the print — which is exactly how a real card looks — and
// z-fighting is handled by polygonOffset on the decal materials (see materials.ts).
//
// Face on +Y, back on −Y. That makes "face down" a single-axis rotation.x = π, and the
// hole-card flip one clean animation (§9.2).
