// The light rig (spec §5). Every intensity below is DERIVED, not chosen by eye.
//
// ── THE CALIBRATION RULE (§5.1) ──
// The brightest diffuse surface in the scene — a white card face, albedo ≈ 0.95, normal
// +Y — must land at linear luminance 0.80–0.90 BEFORE tone mapping. At exposure 1.0 ACES
// maps 0.86 to roughly 0.87 sRGB: a clean paper white with headroom left, so speculars
// have somewhere to go instead of clipping.
//
// Nothing enforced this before, which is how a white chip ended up at 0.84–1.36 on
// diffuse alone and self-glowed. three.js physical units:
//     directional/spot diffuse = dotNL · intensity · albedo / π
//     image-based diffuse      = envColor · environmentIntensity · albedo
//
//   Key         dotNL 0.82 · 1.50 · 0.95 / π  = 0.37
//   Ambient IBL RoomEnvironment @ 0.28        ≈ 0.26
//   Fill        hemisphere @ 0.22             = 0.11
//   Rim                                       ≈ 0.06 (edges only)
//   Lamp pool   spot @ 0.9, decay 0.6, d≈11   = 0.06
//                                       TOTAL ≈ 0.86  ✅
//
// Changing any intensity here means re-doing this arithmetic. Screenshot-verify after.
