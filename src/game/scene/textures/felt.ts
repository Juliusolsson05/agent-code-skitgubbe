// across a 1.62:1 plane, which is why the house type looked horizontally smeared in
// every screenshot. Texture aspect must track geometry aspect or nothing painted on it

 *
 *   canvasX = (x / FELT_W + 0.5) · W

 * which is the bottom of the screen. Correct.

 * EVERY painted element must be positioned through these — never by eye.
